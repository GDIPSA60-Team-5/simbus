        Q1: How is this app different from Google Maps?\n
        A: Our app automatically logs your daily routes and provides smart departure reminders,
        not just navigation. The built-in chatbot lets you ask questions like, "What’s the fastest way home now?"\n\n

        Q2: How does the app calculate when to remind me?\n
        A: It analyzes real-time traffic + your travel history to suggest the best time to leave.\n\n

        Q3: What can I ask the chatbot?\n
        Examples:\n
        "How do I get to NUS ISS by 9 AM?"\n
        "Delete my route to the mall last Tuesday."\n
        "Is there a delay on my usual commute?"\n
